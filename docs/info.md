## How it works

* An 8 bit lfsr powers a random number generator between 1 and 6. Psuedo random number generated using the last three bits of the lfsr.
* When the user turns the dipswitch at locaiton 0 (LSB) to on the number given on the next clock cycle is locked in as the dice roll.
* To roll a number number reset the 0 dipswitch (LSB) to off, and turn it back on again.
* When dipswitch is off dice outputs 0 to seven segment display.
* Note: if the dipswitch at locaiton 0 (LSB) is turned on at startup 0 will be returned / show on the seven second display until it is turned off and back on again.

## How to test

Test by varying timing of dipswitch 0's (LSB) input to on and off.

## External hardware

Uses on board dipswitches, and 7 segment display.
